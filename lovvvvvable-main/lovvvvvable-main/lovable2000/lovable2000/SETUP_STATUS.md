# Jibi - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Already Working

1. **Python Environment**: Configured and all dependencies installed
2. **Frontend**: Running at http://localhost:5173/
3. **BAML Client**: Generated and ready
4. **Dependencies**: All Node.js and Python packages installed

## 🔧 What You Need to Complete the Setup

To get the full AI-powered functionality working, you need to set up cloud services:

### 1. Get a Cloud Account
- Sign up for cloud services
- Get your API tokens from your cloud provider

### 2. Set Up OpenAI API
- Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Add it to your cloud service: `cloud secret create OPENAI_API_KEY 'your-openai-api-key'`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Edit `frontend/.env` and update:
```env
VITE_BEAM_WS_URL=your-websocket-url-from-beam-serve
VITE_BEAM_TOKEN=your-beam-token
```

### 4. Start the Agent Backend
Run this to start the AI agent:
```bash
beam serve src/agent.py:handler
```
This will give you a WebSocket URL to put in your `.env` file.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Frontend Only)

The frontend is already running at http://localhost:5173/

Without the Beam backend, you'll see the UI but won't be able to create AI-generated apps. The frontend includes:
- Modern React + TypeScript setup
- Tailwind CSS styling  
- Component library (shadcn/ui)
- Routing with React Router

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` - Python backend (AI agent)
- `frontend/` - React frontend
- `baml_src/` - AI prompt configuration
- `baml_client/` - Generated AI client code

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. Frontend changes: Edit files in `frontend/src/` (hot reload enabled)
2. Backend changes: Edit `src/agent.py` and redeploy with `beam serve`
3. AI prompt changes: Edit `baml_src/build.baml` and run `make generate`

Enjoy building with Jibi! 🎨
