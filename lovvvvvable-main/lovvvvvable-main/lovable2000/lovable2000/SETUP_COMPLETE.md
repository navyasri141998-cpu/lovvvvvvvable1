# Jibi Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Frontend (Fully Functional)
- **Status**: ✅ Running on port 5000
- **Access**: Click the webview in Replit to see your app
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful dark theme UI with Jibi branding
  - Smooth animations and glass-morphism effects
  - React Router navigation
  - Responsive design
  - All renamed from "Lovable" to "Jibi"

### Backend (Requires External Deployment)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Code ready, needs Beam Cloud deployment
- **Issue**: Beam CLI cannot run in Replit due to system library constraints
- **Solution**: Deploy from your local machine (see instructions below)

## 🔑 API Keys Configured
- ✅ BEAM_TOKEN - Stored in Replit secrets
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY - Stored in Replit secrets

## 🚀 Next Steps to Enable Full AI Features

### Option 1: Deploy Backend from Local Machine (Recommended)

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd jibi
   ```

2. **Install Beam CLI locally**:
   ```bash
   pip install beam-client
   ```

3. **Configure Beam with your token**:
   ```bash
   beam configure --token <your-beam-token>
   ```

4. **Deploy the agent**:
   ```bash
   beam serve src/agent.py:handler
   ```

5. **Copy the WebSocket URL** from the output

6. **Update Replit frontend** by creating `frontend/.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_BEAM_WS_URL=<websocket-url-from-step-5>
   VITE_BEAM_TOKEN=<your-beam-token>
   ```

7. **Restart the frontend** in Replit

### Option 2: Use Frontend-Only Mode (Current)

The frontend works perfectly without the backend for:
- Demonstrating the UI/UX
- Showing the elegant design
- Testing navigation and layout
- Presenting the project concept

The AI code generation features will show as disabled until you connect the backend.

## 🎨 Branding Complete

All instances of "Lovable" have been renamed to "Jibi":
- ✅ Code files updated
- ✅ Configuration files updated  
- ✅ Asset files renamed (jibi-demo.gif)
- ✅ Sandbox names changed
- ✅ UI displays "Jibi" branding

## 🌐 Current Preview

Your frontend is live at port 5000! Features you can see now:
- Landing page with Jibi branding
- "Next-Generation AI Web Builder" tagline
- Beautiful dark theme interface
- Navigation system
- Responsive layout

## 📚 Documentation Created

- `replit.md` - Project overview and development guide
- `BACKEND_SETUP.md` - Detailed backend setup instructions
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

## 💡 Why Beam Can't Run in Replit

Beam requires system libraries (libstdc++.so.6) that aren't available in the Replit NixOS environment. The Beam CLI needs to be run from:
- Your local machine
- A cloud VM
- GitHub Codespaces
- Any environment with full system access

## 🔄 Deployment Configuration

The Replit deployment is configured for the frontend:
- Build: `npm run build --prefix frontend`
- Run: Vite preview on port 5000
- Type: Autoscale (stateless frontend)

## ✨ What You Have

1. A fully functional, beautifully designed frontend
2. Complete backend code ready for deployment
3. All branding updated to "Jibi"
4. API keys securely stored
5. Deployment configuration ready
6. Comprehensive documentation

Deploy the backend from your local machine to unlock the full AI-powered code generation capabilities!
