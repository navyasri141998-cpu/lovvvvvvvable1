4. **Add `.env`**

Create an `.env` file in `/frontend`

You’ll need a [Beam token](https://platform.beam.cloud/settings/api-keys) and the websocket URL, printed in your shell after running the command below.

```bash
VITE_BEAM_WS_URL=your-agent-ws-url # URL printed in your shell after running `beam serve` - fill this in after running the command below
VITE_CLOUD_TOKEN=your-cloud-token # Get your cloud service token from your provider
```

## Usage

### Start the Agent

The agent handles real-time communication with the client/frontend:

```bash
beam serve src/agent.py:handler
```

> Paste the websocket URL printed in your shell into your `.env` file above

### Run the Frontend

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### BAML / Prompts

Prompts are defined in `baml_src/build.baml`:

- **EditCode Function** - Main function for code generation
- **CodeChanges Schema** - Defines the structure of AI responses
- **Test Cases** - Validate prompt behavior

> If you want to change the prompt, edit `baml_src/build.baml` and run `make generate` to regenerate the BAML clients

### Sandbox Environment

The sandbox environment is managed in `src/tools.py`:

- Node.js 20 base image
- React + Vite + shadcn/ui template
- Other deps: React Router, Recharts, TanStack Query, etc.
